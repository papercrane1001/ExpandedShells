	1.4 NOTE: Boomalope shells are not working yet.  I'll keep working on it, but I wanted to get the VHE shell, big firefoam shell, and soap shells out, since they're the ones I use most often.  \n
	
	This mod adds artillery shells in keeping with vanilla that are in between existing shells.\n
	For the moment, four shells are added: \n
	a "Very High Explosive Shell," which has the same damage stats as the High Explosive Shell but has a larger blast radius,\n
	a "Heavy Firefoam Shell," which again spreads firefoam over a larger area, and \n
	a "Soap Shell," which removes filth in a large area around the shell.  \n
	a "Boomalope Shell," which releases some angry boomalopes around the shell.  
	
	Planned:
	a "Silver Shell," which tempts raiders to abandon the raid in favor of gathering the spread silver,
	a "Hat Shell," which inflicts a "horrified" debuff on nearby raiders,
	an "Acid Shell," which causes a damage over time hediff, and
	a "Turret Shell," which drops a self-powered mini-turret at its point of impact.
	
	Also, textures.  If anyone likes making textures, I would appreciate textures for my shells, because my attempts at textures are terrible.
