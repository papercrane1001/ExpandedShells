	<description>This mod adds artillery shells in keeping with vanilla that are in between existing shells.\n
	For the moment, three shells are added: \n
	a "Very High Explosive Shell," which has the same damage stats as the High Explosive Shell but has a larger blast radius,\n
	a "Heavy Firefoam Shell," which again spreads firefoam over a larger area, and \n
	a "Soap Shell," which removes filth in a large area around the shell.  
	\n\nCredit to prism's MortarManiac and Noodles' More Psycasts for some extremely useful code.  
	\n\nVersion 1.0.0
	\nFor version 1.3.</description>
